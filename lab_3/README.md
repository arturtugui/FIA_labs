1. Exploratory data analysis

## Step 1.1 — Load and inspect the catalogue

- the initial data.csv has in the 1st row all the column names and all the subsequent rows dont seem to have multiple entries per cell

- so i made a script that puts each ; in its own cell

- `processed_data/1_1_readable_catalogue.csv` - one row per mushroom and one column per
  field, so the data can be inspected in a spreadsheet without changing the
  original semicolon-delimited source.


## Step 1.2 — Unique values and missingness

* 1.2.1 row analysis

Unique values below mean distinct, nonblank raw cell contents. Bracketed values
such as `[x, f]` are counted as one cell value here. Empty-cell percentages for
columns use all 173 rows.

| Statistic | family | name | class | cap-diameter | cap-shape | Cap-surface | cap-color | does-bruise-or-bleed | gill-attachment | gill-spacing | gill-color | stem-height | stem-width | stem-root | stem-surface | stem-color | veil-type | veil-color | has-ring | ring-type | Spore-print-color | habitat | season |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Unique values | 23 | 173 | 2 | 51 | 27 | 40 | 67 | 2 | 8 | 3 | 59 | 46 | 48 | 5 | 14 | 41 | 1 | 7 | 2 | 13 | 8 | 21 | 10 |
| Empty cells (%) | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 23.1% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 16.2% | 41.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 84.4% | 62.4% | 0.0% | 94.8% | 87.9% | 0.0% | 4.0% | 89.6% | 0.0% | 0.0% |

Columns with fewer than 5 unique cell values:

| Column | Values |
|---|---|
| class | `p`, `e` |
| does-bruise-or-bleed | `[f]`, `[t]` |
| gill-spacing | `[c]`, `[d]`, `[f]` |
| veil-type | `[u]` |
| has-ring | `[t]`, `[f]` |

* 1.2.2 columns types

For this analysis, `name` is the identifier, `family` is the classification target, `class` is a separate analysis label, and the remaining 20 mushroom-description columns are features.

* 1.2.3 row analysis

The following table groups rows by the percentage of their 23 columns that are
empty. The bands include their lower bound and exclude their upper bound, except
for the final band. Exactly 0% is also shown separately.

| Empty columns per row (% of 23) | Number of rows |
|---|---:|
| Exactly 0% | 0 |
| 0–<20% | 50 |
| 20–<40% | 123 |
| 40–<60% | 0 |
| 60–<80% | 0 |
| 80–100% | 0 |

Rows have 2–8 empty columns, averaging 5.03 empty columns per row.

* 1.2.4 row duplicates

I checked for exact duplicate rows, repeated `name` identifiers, and repeated
mushroom feature profiles (the 20 description columns, excluding `family`,
`name`, and `class`). All three checks found 0 duplicates. A repeated identifier
is one kind of duplicate, but identical records or feature profiles are separate
checks.
